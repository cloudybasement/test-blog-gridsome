## Easy, local development

Build websites with modern tools like Vue.js, GraphQL & all the power of Node.js & the JavaScript ecosystem. Develop locally and get instant hot-reloading for any code change.

## Fast by default

Gridsome builds ultra performance into every page by using the PRPL pattern. You get code splitting, asset optimization, progressive images, and link prefetching out of the box. Gridsome sites get almost perfect page speed scores by default.

## PWA-ready

Gridsome generates static PWAs. Only critical HTML, CSS, and JavaScript get loaded first. The next pages are then prefetched so users can click around incredibly fast without page reloads, even when offline.

## Build on the Jamstack

The future of the web is JavaScript, APIs, and Markup - the Jamstack. Gridsome uses the power of blazing fast static site generation, JavaScript and APIs to create stunning modern web experiences.

## Simple, safe deployment

No servers. No databases. Only files. Deploy your entire site to a CDN and forget about it. A Gridsome site can handle thousands to millions of hits without breaking - and no expensive server costs.

## SEO-friendly

Gridsome sites loads as static HTML before it hydrates into a fully Vue.js-powered SPA. This makes it possible for search engines able to crawl content and give better SEO ranking, and still have all the power of Vue.js.
